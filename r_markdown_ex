Gentrification is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as "a housing, economic, and health issue that affects a community's history and culture and reduces social capital." New businesses and resources are brought into neighborhoods that historically have been "low value" in order to turn them into "high value" areas where new people will move into. While Chicago is not one of the top cities in this country being rapidly gentrified, it is a major city being impacted by changing policies nonetheless. The following visualizations are used to examine the gentrification process in Chicago over the last decade.
